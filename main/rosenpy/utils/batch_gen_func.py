sequential or shuffled.
"""

def batch_sequential(module, x, y, batch_size=1):
    """
    Generates sequential batches of data for neural network training.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xp : module
        CuPy or NumPy module for array handling.
    x : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_inputs)
        Training vectors as real numbers, where n_samples is the number of
        samples and n_inputs is the number of input features.
    y : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Target values representing the desired outputs.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Size of each batch. If batch_size equals 1, the algorithm will 
        perform Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x_batches : array-like, shape (n_batches, batch_size, n_inputs)
        Batches of training inputs.
    y_batches : array-like, shape (n_batches, batch_size, n_outputs)
        Batches of target outputs.
